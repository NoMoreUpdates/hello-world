Hello humans!

Okay enough of following the script.
Here's my background basically the most coding I've done was back in college (2013-2016) earning my AAS in Computer Programming and 
  Database Mangement.
In this degree I learned some Python, Java, HTML5/CSS/Javascript, and SQL Server. It was fun, but I never got the chance to use it in real
  world application because all the places I applied to code wanted experience (even the intro level positions).
I settled with a computer repair job and really haven't touched the coding world much since then, but that's going to change.
I want to become more adept since this is something I want to do in the future.

Thank you for reading and I can't wait to grow here and there and everywhere with you!
